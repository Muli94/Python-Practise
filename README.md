# Python-Practise

A personal repository for learning and practicing Python programming concepts.

## About This Repository

Coming from a JavaScript/TypeScript background with experience in React and NestJS, this repository serves as my playground for learning Python. It contains exercises, small projects, and notes as I explore Python's syntax, libraries, and best practices.

## Learning Goals

- Master Python syntax and basic programming concepts
- Understand Python's approach to object-oriented programming
- Learn how to work with Python's standard libraries
- Explore popular Python frameworks and tools
- Build small projects to apply newly acquired knowledge

## Key Differences from JavaScript/TypeScript

As someone transitioning from JavaScript/TypeScript, here are some key differences to note:

- Python uses indentation (whitespace) for code blocks instead of curly braces
- Python is dynamically typed but uses type hints (similar to TypeScript)
- No `const`, `let`, or `var` - variables are declared directly
- Functions are defined with `def` instead of `function`
- Python has tuples and lists instead of just arrays
- Classes are more straightforward with less boilerplate than TypeScript classes

## Contribution

This is a personal learning repository, but suggestions for improvements or interesting exercises are welcome!
